# Community Data

## Introduction: 

This tool is intended for use to St. Louis Public Library employees to better understand the communities they serve. Development of this project took place from September 2021 through May 2022. Data analysis and development was led by Emma Baker (emma.baker@wustl.edu) and work was overseen by Joe Monahan. Any questions about the scope of this project or bugs can be directed to jmonahan@slpl.org.
